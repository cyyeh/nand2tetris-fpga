### Memory Map

 |address | memory|R/W|function|
 |-|-|-|-|
 |0-3839  | RAM|R/W|R0--R15, static, stack, heap|
 | 8192    | but|R/W|0 = button pressed, 1 = button released|
 | 8193    | led|R/W|0 = led off, 1 = led on|
 | 8194    | UART-TX|R|-1 = busy, 0 = ready|
 | 8194    | UART-TX|W|write char to be send|
 | 8195    | UART-RX|R|>=0 received byte, <0 busy|
 | 8195    | UART-RX|W|write -1 to clear buffer|
 |8196|r_sram_addr|R/W|SRAM address for next operation|
 |8197|r_sram_data|R|SRAM data at selected address|

## Hack9_tb.v
The Testbench `Hack9_tb.v` performs the following tasks:
* writes data to SD card reader.

## Project

* Implement `Hack9.v`
* Preload `ROM.v` with `asm/sd/sd.hack`
* Simulate with testbench `Hack9_tb.v`  
`$ apio sim`
* Compare output with `Hack9_tb.png`
* Connect SD card reader to GPIO.
* Preload `ROM.v` with `asm/boot/boot.hack`
* Build and upload to iCE40-HX1K-EVB  
 `$ apio upload`
* Run `boot.hack` on Hack9 in real hardware.
* Do software part of project `jack/SDTest`
