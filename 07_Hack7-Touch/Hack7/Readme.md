## Hack7.v
Writing to memory address 8203 sends the lower 8 bits to Touchpanel. Reading from memory address 8203 returns -1 if Touchpanel module is busy else the last received byte is returned.

## Hack7_tb.v
The Testbench `Hack7_tb.v` performs the following tasks:
* writes data: 55 to MOSI
* MOSI is inverted to MISO, so ~55 should be received.

## Project

* Implement `Hack7.v`
* Preload `ROM.v` with `asm/touch/touch.hack`
* Simulate with testbench `Hack7_tb.v`  
`$ apio sim`
* Compare output with `Hack7_tb.png`
* Connect Touchpanel controller of MOD-LCD-2.8RTP to iCE40-HX1K-EVB with three more jumper wires.
* Preload `ROM.v` with `asm/boot/boot.hack`
* Build and upload to iCE40-HX1K-EVB  
 `$ apio upload`
* Run `boot.hack` on Hack7 in real hardware.
* Do software part of project `jack/TouchTest`
