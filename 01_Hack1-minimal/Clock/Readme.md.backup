## Clock.v
![](Clock.png)

The module Clock provides the clock-signal for all sequential logic inside the fpga. It gets an input in of 100MHz from an external oscillator and delivers the output out 100/3 = 33.333333 MHz.

This is done because Hack will not run errorfree in real hardware when clocked to fast.

## Clock_tb.v
Testbench to generate clock signal.

## Project
* Implement the module `Clock.v` and all needed submodules.  
**Note:** DFF and Nand are considered primitive and thus there is no need to implement them.
* Simulate your implementation with the supplied testbench `Clock_tb.v`.
* Verify by comparing with screenshot of `Clock_tb.png`.
