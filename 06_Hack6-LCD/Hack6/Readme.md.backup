## Hack6.v
Writing to memory address 8200 sends the lower 8 bits to LCD as command. Writing to memory address 8201/8202 sends 8/16 bit to LCD as data. Reading from memory address 8200-8202 returns 0 if LCD module is ready and <0 (sign bit set) if LCD module is busy.

## Project

* Implement `Hack6.v`
* Preload `ROM.v` with `asm/lcd/lcd.hack`
* Simulate with testbench `Hack6_tb.v`  
`$ apio sim`
* Compare output with `Hack6_tb.png`
* Connect MOD-LCD-28 to iCE40-HX1K-EVB with jumper wires.
* Preload `ROM.v` with `asm/boot/boot.hack`
* Build and upload to iCE40-HX1K-EVB  
 `$ apio upload`
* Run `boot.hack` on Hack6 in real hardware.
* Do software part of project
